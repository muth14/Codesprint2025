Problem Statement: Many communities, especially rural areas, have limited access to healthcare facilities, and medical services are often expensive. How can digital platforms, telemedicine, or AI-powered diagnostics improve healthcare access and affordability for underserved populations?

Abstract:
Our project is centered around developing a healthcare-focused chatbot tailored for individuals in rural areas. This chatbot, equipped with an AI voice assistant, will support local languages to enhance accessibility. Its main goal is to provide information about government schemes and help users navigate the application process. By gathering user information, the chatbot can recommend schemes based on eligibility, streamlining the application experience.

In contrast to current platforms that simply list schemes, our chatbot provides interactive support, allowing users to ask questions and resolve any uncertainties regarding the schemes. With 61% of people in rural India unaware of the central governmentâ€™s initiatives and life insurance options, our project seeks to close this knowledge gap and make a meaningful difference. Additionally, the chatbot will be integrated with WhatsApp, ensuring ease of use and wider reach within rural communities.
